This folder has the basic infrastucture for using the Starter approach for a single web application.

It contains the terraform and ansible scripts for the creation and integration of the web server for hosting the application, as well as the means for deploying changes using the local machine.

This is an approach more suited for the development of a single project based on the Starter boilerplate.
