## Introduction
This folder encompasses a complete infrastructure for custom web development using the Starter approach.

It contains the development environment, terraform and ansible scripts for the creation and integration of the Jenkins server used for CI/CD and the web server for hosting the application.

This is a complete approach more suited for the development of multiple projects based on the Starter boilerplate.
